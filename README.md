# Customer Segmentation

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project documentation for Nexus Bank. This project aims to analyze customer behavior and preferences to gain insights into customer segmentation and predict their likelihood of defaulting on payments or subscribing to term deposits. By understanding customer segments better, Nexus Bank can tailor its services and strategies to meet the specific needs of different customer groups.

## Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior that influence their attitude towards defaulting on payments and their propensity to subscribe to term deposits. By understanding these factors, Nexus Bank can make informed decisions and develop targeted strategies to minimize defaults and enhance term deposit subscription rates.

## Methodology

The project follows a systematic methodology consisting of the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The initial step involves cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data quality. This includes handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables if necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. It involves visualizing and analyzing the data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables. This analysis provides valuable insights that guide subsequent steps.

3. Feature Engineering: Based on the insights gained from EDA, relevant features are selected or created to improve the predictive power of the model. This step involves transforming variables, creating new features, and selecting the most influential variables for customer segmentation.

4. Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical variables are converted into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms. One-hot encoding or other encoding techniques are applied to represent categorical variables as binary features.

5. Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the models, while the testing set is used to evaluate their performance on unseen data.

6. Scaling/Normalization: Numerical variables are scaled or normalized to ensure they are on a similar scale. This step prevents variables with large magnitudes from dominating the model training process and ensures fair comparisons between features.

7. Model Training: Various machine learning models are trained on the training data. These models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or other suitable algorithms for customer segmentation.

8. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using the testing data. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves are computed to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting customer behavior.

9. Model Selection and Deployment: Based on the evaluation results, the model that demonstrates the best performance and generalizability is selected. This model is recommended for deployment in real-world scenarios to segment customers and make predictions about their defaulting behavior and term deposit subscription likelihood.

## Conclusion

The Customer Segmentation project for Nexus Bank aims to identify customer segments based on behavior patterns and predict their defaulting tendencies and term deposit subscription likelihood. By understanding customer segments better, Nexus Bank can personalize its services, optimize marketing strategies, and proactively manage default risks. This documentation provides an overview of the project's goals, methodology, and the steps involved in achieving accurate customer segmentation.
